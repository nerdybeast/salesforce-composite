## Running Tests

In the root of the `Salesforce.Composite.Tests` project, create a file called `appsettings.json` with this structure:

```
{
	"AppSettings": {
		//...
	}
}
```

Have a look at the `AppSettings.cs` class file for the available properties.

> Note: The `appsettings.json` file is ignored from the repo to prevent sensitive information from being added to source control.
